## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

As someone who is almost interested in learning about ways to earn a passive income, I can't help but wonder:
What factors determine the price of a listing?
What are the best months in a year to be the host?
What do guests care most? And how to write a description that speaks their mind?

To answer these questions, I will be exploring the Seattle Airbnb dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data) that contains the 2016's listing information.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

1 notebook - Airbnb.ipynb contains codes and plots.
Datasets:
